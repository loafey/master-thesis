All in all a very well written report. Although I lack knowledge in this area,
it felt like I could eventually understand everything.

Sorry for the rambly structure. If you don't understand what we are referring
to, then I'd say ignore it. The text is very good in general.

- TEXT: In contrast, aggregation approaches that summarize data at coarser resolutions lose detail that might be needed for specific analytical questions
  THOUGHT: Complex wording for someone outside the area. If you think someone in the domain would understand, then keep it.

- BEFORE: The parameter selection is critical, as inappropriate ... 
  AFTER:  The parameter selection is critical, because inappropriate ...

- Indentation in Pseudocode 2.1 is a bit confusing. I assume it is used to denote "blocks", but then the indentation under the If is strange

- BEFORE: Since this algorithm is guaranteed 
  AFTER: Because this algorithm is guaranteed

- BEFORE: lose effectiveness [39], as even ... 
  AFTER:  lose effectiveness [39], because even ... 

- BEFORE: while the exact measurement at 02.00 
  AFTER: while the same measurement at 02.00 

- Text under 4.2 Core Components could perhaps spoil the sub-chapter a bit, so that I (the reader) know what to expect.

- BEFORE: as it utilizes minimum and maximum distances 
  AFTER: because it utilizes minimum and maximum distance

- BEFORE: as it can handle arbitrary 
  AFTER: because it can handle arbitrary

- Many concepts are reintroduced in later chapters. For example: 

- 3.2 High-Dimensional Time Series Clustering Challenges,
  REPEAT: about how time series is hard to work with due to high dimensionality.

- 3.2.1 Dimensionality Effects on Distance Metrics and Computation,
  REPEAT: about why high dimensionality is hard to work with.

- 3.2.2 Temporal Dependencies and Structure,
  REPEAT: why temporal data is hard to work with.

- 3.3 The Parameterization Problem,
  REPEAT: why parameter choice is important to work with.

- 3.4 Feature Engineering vs Raw Data Approaches,
  REPEAT: about this.

- While CLUE offers many different clustering algorithms it primarily
  uses density-based methods for several reasons (this is a REPEAT):

- Repeat: info about DBSCAN, IP.LSH.DBSCAN and K-means. 

- 4.2.2 Distance/Similarity Metrics,
  THOUGHTS: DTW should be introduced in theory.
