IM ON PAGE 30 (SKIPPED SOME BACKGROUND)

# Questions
- Figure 4.2: What determines the results to be "presentable"
- No Pre-specified Cluster Count: Is this computationally feasible? K-means is NP-hard already
- Why is DBSCAN the reference standard?

# Thoughts
- There a lot of defintions to digest in 2.0. After finishing this section I definitely hope everything is relevant
- 3.6 very good section to include, nicely done!

# Text nitpicking
- The parameter selection is critical, as inappropriate ... >> The parameter selection is critical, because inappropriate ...
- Indentation in Pseudocode 2.1 is a bit confusing. I assume it is used to denote "blocks", but then the indentation under the If is strange
- Since this algorithm is guaranteed >> Because this algorithm is guaranteed
- lose effectiveness [39], as even ... >>  lose effectiveness [39], because even ... 
- while the exact measurement at 02.00 >> while the same measurement at 02.00 
- Text under 4.2 Core Components could perhaps spoil the sub-chapter a bit, so that I (the reader) know what to expect.
