== Previous work

In the previous year (2024), Nordmark wrote his
master's thesis "Towards a practical execution model for functional
languages with linear types" @nordmark2024.
This work can be seen as a sort of predecessor of the work presented in this thesis,
and is similar in nature to his thesis. Nordmark compiled a language similar to #ln to
an untyped byte code, which ran in a custom virtual machine. Even though using
a virtual machine is a suitable first step, we deem that this is not low-level
enough for a system-level language.
