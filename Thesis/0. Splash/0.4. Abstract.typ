This thesis presents the design, compilation, ABI, and logic behind the language #ln.
The language aims to fill the hole created by the lack of
functional system-level, linear, and intermediate representation languages.
#ln tries to combine all of these concepts into one coherent experience.

The language is based on the theory of linear logic and lambda calculus, and
exclusively uses continuation passing style. The implementation presented in
this paper is compiled to x86-64.
