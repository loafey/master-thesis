= Usage
As of this report #ln is in it's infancy and it is very limited, but #ln has been used
to write some smaller programs!

== Fibonacci
Fibonacci is not the most the most interesting program,
but from the standpoint of linearity it is _somewhat_ interesting, as
it requires the reuse of variables:
#align(
  center,
  grid(
    row-gutter: 10pt,
    $F_n = F_(n - 1) + F_(n - 2)$,
    $F_0 = 0$,
    $F_1 = 1$,
  ),
)
The following is two different implementions, one in Lithium,
and a recursive one in C. /*, and a recursive one in Haskell, as to compare it against
                          a mature functional programming language:*/

As can be seen in the benchmarks in @fibbo-benchmarks there is quite a
large gap between the version written in #ln and the version written in C.
However, while the #ln version is some magnitudes slower, we can see that
the exponential growth in execution time is almost the same accross
all three versions.

This can be observed even more clearly if we overlap the benchmakrs over
each other, and then we can see that the un-opitimized C version grows
the same way as the #ln version, while the optimized C version is slightly
more efficient.
#figure(caption: [Benchmarks overlapped], overlap)

The performance difference we can see @fibbo-benchmarks
can be attributed to several factors but the two most significant ones
are most likely that #ln is currently not optimized at all, and it
genereates more code than is likely necessary. Also worth to note
that the calling convention is heavier compared to System V#todo[source] which
C uses, and that this is not the most performant implemention you can create in
C. A version using looping and some basic memoization is much more performant.

// As is to be expected, the Haskell version falls far behind both, but
