*FIXED* 1. New Detail: bottom of pdf page 3 (in the frontmatter): 2024 := 2025
*FIXED* 2. 1: "can not" := "cannot" everywhere (you changed in the opposite direction)
*FIXED* 3. New: "static function poiner" := "static function pointer"
*FIXED* 4. 18: "to turn Lithium into a sublanguage which can then be mapped to assembly" := "to map Lithium terms into a sublanguage which we then translate to assembly"
  (As discussed, you don't change the language, only the terms / expressions / etc. in the language.)
*NOTE: I agree. This was something that we did with JP in a short meeting. If we had more time, we would discuss this further* 5. (20+21: I'll let this slip, but I think this indicates that the design is not finished.)

*FIXED: You are correct. The box that is removed is a bug, it should still be there* 
6. 22a: No, not only the let is moving; you also get rid of a box. You start from 
    t1 = 𝜆(𝑓, 𝑘). 𝑘(□𝜆𝑦. let □𝑓′ = 𝑓; 𝑓′(𝑦)) : *(□∼𝐴 ⊗ ∼(□∼𝐴))
  Note that k is applied to a box (with a lambda-expr inside).
  Then you end up with
    t2 = 𝜆(𝑓, 𝑘). let □𝑓′ = 𝑓; 𝑘(𝜆𝑦. 𝑓′(𝑦)) : *(□∼𝐴 ⊗ ∼(□∼𝐴))
  Note that k is now applied to a lambda directly, without a box. Is this still type correct?
  Has the type of k changed in the process? I have not read your typing rules in enough detail to know, but it feels fishy.
7. 22b: The reader won't need a complete and detailed explanation if you include a link to the actual code somewhere. So please do that.

8. New: detail: p21: the last cell of the table does not quite fit: I suggest you shrink the width of the first column to fix it.

*FIXED: Added an important note that this must be fulfilled* 9. 28: OK, but note that the semantics is just a function, and a "user" could call that function with anything of the right type (any rho : Var -> List Reg). Perhaps you are saved by "Lastly, the number of registers 𝜌 maps the variable 𝑥 to must be exactly ⟦Γ(𝑥)⟧R , i.e |𝜌(𝑥)| = ⟦Γ(𝑥)⟧R ."? If so, explain that (briefly).

*FIXED* 10. 38: I really don't think you should use "a + b = z" as the notation for variable duplication in the same code that also uses "r1 + r2" to mean addition of numbers. If you don't want to use the notation "a = b = z" then please use "a & b = z" or some other operator.

*FIXED* 11. New: 5.2.5: The first fib has "inl () -> k(0)" (and -> k(1)), but the second fib has "inr () -> k(0)" (and -> k(1)). Mistake or some unexplained transformation?
