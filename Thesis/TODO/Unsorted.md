## 4 Compiling Lithium
- [ ] "something that can be": be more specific - perhaps "an intermediate
  representations ..."

- [ ] "application binary Interface" := "application binary interface"

- [ ] I would like to understand the "compilation pipeline" a bit more
  here before you delve into the different parts. Is 4.1 about a
  source-to-source transformation within the calculus? The remark "At
  this stage Lithium is still a calculus" makes it sound like you will
  actually extend the language/calculus as you explain the
  translation. Or do you mean that you will identify a "sublanguage"
  within the full Lithium syntax? Please clarify.

- 4.1 Transformations
  - [ ] "The first three phases": I suggest you remake this paragraph into a
    numbered list with "name + explanation + forward reference" for each
    list item.
  - [ ] "It is important not to forget": I suggest you rephrase/shorten:
    perhaps "The corresponding transformation of the negative fragment
    ..."
  - [ ] "Because the type ¬�� is transformed ... the type checker should
    allow □ ∼ �� where ¬�� is expected": I don't see why this is the
    case. You should be able to think about the language before and
    after translation as two slightly different sublanguages, which
    may require different typing rules, but allowing any mix of the
    two seems "dangerous".
  - [ ] "end up being ill-kinded" - the story-line seems a bit strange:
    you say that 4.1.2 shows how to transform the types to keep them
    well-kinded. But then the closures don't "end up being ill-kinded"
    after all. Perhaps you meant to motivate why the 4.1.2
    transormation is needed?
  - [ ] "can not" := "cannot"
  - [ ] 4.1.2: I don't get this part
  - [ ] 4.1.3: Same here: I find this subsection very hard to penetrate. Examples:
    - [ ] "The issue is that the only variable that is a stack is ��′, but
      it cannot be the chosen stack because bound variables are stored
      on the stack." ??
    - [ ] "Because ��′ is a stack, and a free variable in ����.��′(��),
      pairvars does not need to construct a newstack." ??
    - [ ] "⟨○, (��∗ (��, ��1 ). freestack ��1 ; foo(��), ����������������)⟩" ??      
  - [ ] "… ⊗ ���� If Γ" := "… ⊗ ����. If Γ" (sentence-ending period missing)
  - [ ] "pairvars" (one use) or "pairsvars" (two uses)?
  - [ ] How can "unpairAll" invert "this procdure" without taking Gamma as
    an argument?

- 4.2 Compilation Scheme
  - [ ] "every aspect of Lithium is based on a set of rules": I'm not sure
    what you are trying to say here. The transformations and
    compilation is not described in the rules of section 3.3.
  - [ ] "The syntax ��, (�� ↦ ���� )" := "The notation ��, (�� ↦ ���� )"
  - [ ] It is a bit confusing to introduce "The function ��", then say "the
    context ��" in the next sentence.
  - [ ] "��0 + +��1" := "��0 ++ ��1" - probably should be \mathbin{{+}{+}} or
    something like that.
  - [ ] "Formally, �� can be seen as a function �� : Γ → List(Reg).": I
    understand what you mean, but this does not "type check": Gamma is
    a context, not a type. Also the combination of "Formally" and "can
    be seen as" is odd. Perhaps: "rho : Var -> List(Reg)". Or
    "rho_Gamma : dom(Gamma) -> List(Reg)". I'm also not sure if empty
    lists are "allowed".
  - [ ] "The range of �� is a list of pseudo registers": no. The range of a
    function f : A->B is the _set_ of values of type B it can return.
    Here a set of lists (of pseudo-registers).
  - [ ] "that ��(��) is correctly loaded with values": perhaps "that the
    registers in ��(��) are correctly loaded with values"?
    - Also, what is "��" here? 
  - [ ] The boxes for "Right injection" and "Left injection" seem to be
    mixed up. (Right uses inl, Left uses inr on p24.)
  - [ ] "Static function": the text in the box talks about r_1 but the
    code uses r.
  - [ ] The long figures look impressive, but I'm a bit worried about the
    "pattern matching" on things like "��,��↦[��0]": what happens if the
    list that z maps to is not a singleton list?

- 4.3 Compilation target
  - [ ] style: "a developer can not guarantee", "gives us the ability", "a
    lot of": too informal / different in style from the rest.
  - [ ] "like LLVM IR, provide" := "like LLVM IR provide"

- 4.4. Language ABI
  - [ ] "As with any language ... ABI": that is clearly not the case. Why
    define an ABI for lambda calculus, or SQL, or HTML? Perhaps "any
    system-level language"?
  - [ ] "jump(" := "jump ("
  - [ ] 4.4.2: "following chapter": "subsection" or "table"
  - [ ] "⟦��⟧�� = ℕ": ? do you mean "⟦��⟧�� : ℕ"?
  - [ ] "⟦��⟧M + ∞"?? ∞ is not in ℕ.
  - [ ] (I had to start skimming here, after too many hours on reading.)
## 5
- [ ] "there is quite a large gap": be more concrete - it looks like a
  factor of around 40 at n=30.

- [ ] clarify that the growth is exponential (for all versions), but also
  give check if the growth rate is the same. Explain Fig 26.

- [ ] It would be nice to see the corresponding comparison for a more
  clever fibonacci with linear run time (in all the versions). Or is
  that not possible in Lithium?
## 6
- OK
