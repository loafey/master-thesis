- [ ] It would be nice to see the corresponding comparison for a more
  clever fibonacci with linear run time (in all the versions). Or is
  that not possible in Lithium?

- 2.2
  - [ ] Nice with some citations, but a bit assymmetric, given so few above.

## 1 Intro
- 1.2 Motivation
  - [ ] There are parts here which seem to be the logic version of the
    systems backgroud from 1.1.
  - [ ] Perhaps restructure to have 1.1 "Context: Functional programming
    meets system-level coding" or even "Linear logic" instead of FP.


  - [ ] The long figures look impressive, but I'm a bit worried about the
    "pattern matching" on things like "��,��↦[��0]": what happens if the
    list that z maps to is not a singleton list?
