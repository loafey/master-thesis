## 2 Background
- 2.3
  - [ ] 1st paragraph: style/tone: this is the first use of "you" in the
    whole thesis. I suggest you rephrase to keep the text more
    consistent.

## 4 Compiling Lithium
- 4.3 Compilation target
  - [ ] style: "a developer can not guarantee", "gives us the ability", "a

  - [ ] "like LLVM IR, provide" := "like LLVM IR provide"

- 4.4. Language ABI
  - [ ] "jump(" := "jump ("
  - [ ] 4.4.2: "following chapter": "subsection" or "table"
  - [ ] "⟦��⟧�� = ℕ": ? do you mean "⟦��⟧�� : ℕ"?
  - [ ] "⟦��⟧M + ∞"?? ∞ is not in ℕ.
  - [ ] (I had to start skimming here, after too many hours on reading.)
