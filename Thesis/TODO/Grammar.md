## Abstract:
- [ ] "studied" := "well-documented?"

- [ ] "By leveraging the restrictions linear types impose" sounds a bit
  confusing: try to formulate in a positive direction: the
  "restrictions" lead to better / stronger guarantees, etc. -
  perhaps "By leveraging the guarantees provided by ..."

- [ ] "based a variant" := "based on a variant"    

- [ ] "The purpose of Lithium as an intermediate compilation target." ??
  fragment. Perhaps "Lithium is design to be an ..."?

## 2 Background
- 2.1 Lambda calculus and linear types
  - [ ] "We will introduce the simply typed lambda calculus, then
    extending it with polymorphic types, and end by introducing linear
    types.": grammar suggestion: "... introduce the simply typed
    lambda calculus, extend it with polymorphic types, and introduce
    linear types."
  - [ ] "Linear types does" := "Linear types do"

- 2.2 Continuation-passing Style
  - [ ] "A natural question that comes to mind is why we want
    continuation-passing style?": perhaps "A natural question is: what
    are the advantages of using continuation-passing style?"

- 2.3
  - [ ] 1st paragraph: style/tone: this is the first use of "you" in the
    whole thesis. I suggest you rephrase to keep the text more
    consistent.
  - [ ] "some commons examples" typo

## 3. Lithium
- 3.3: Types & values
  - [ ] "aforementioned" := "" (not needed) or "typing"

  - [ ] "typing proof" := "typing derivation"

  - [ ] Fig. 15: "identity function" := "identity function on A"
