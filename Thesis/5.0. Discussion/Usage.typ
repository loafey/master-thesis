== Usage<Fibbo>
Fibonacci is not the most the most interesting program,
but from the standpoint of linearity it is _somewhat_ interesting, as
it requires the reuse of variables:

#align(
  center,
  grid(
    row-gutter: 10pt,
    $F_n = F_(n - 1) + F_(n - 2)$,
    $F_0 = 0$,
    $F_1 = 1$,
  ),
)

The following are two different implementations, one in Lithium,
and a recursive one in C.

This program uses the compiler defined functions `__dup__` and `__eq__`.
`__dup__` has the type signature $*(int times.circle ~(int times.circle int))$,
which means it takes a tuple of an integer to duplicate, and a continuation that takes the
two new integers as argument.
`__eq__` has type signature $*(int times.circle int times.circle ~(fatone plus.circle fatone))$. 
This function takes two integers to check for equality, and a continuation that takes the result as argument.
The value `inl ()` represents true and the value `inr ()` represents false.

x-axis represents the input to the fibonacci function. Note that the y-axis grows logarithmically.

As can be seen in the benchmarks in @fibbo-benchmarks there is quite a
large gap between the version written in #ln and the version written in C.
Each input was measured 100 times.
The C version was compiled using GCC with O0 and O3.
However, while the #ln version is around one order of magniture slower than the unoptimized C verison,
the growth in execution time is a constant factor between all three programs.

This can be observed even more clearly if we overlap the benchmarks over
each other, and then we can see that the unoptimized C version grows
the same way as the #ln version, while the optimized C version is slightly
more efficient.
#figure(caption: [Benchmarks from @fibbo-benchmarks overlapped], overlap)

The performance difference we can see @fibbo-benchmarks
can be attributed to several factors but the two most significant ones
are most likely that #ln is currently not optimized at all, and it
generates more code than is likely necessary. Also worth to note
that the calling convention is less performant than System V @SystemVmatz2013system which
C uses. System V prioritizes passing arguments using registers while #ln strictly passes arguments on stacks.

// Overall a benchmark is currently not necessarily that interesting #todo[Either remove the entire chapter or this paragraph] in #ln current state.
// They are presented here nonetheless to showcase some of the language's current capabilities.
