== Usage<Fibbo>
Fibonacci is not the most interesting program,
but from the standpoint of linearity it is _somewhat_ interesting, because
it requires the reuse of variables:

$
  & F(0) = 0\
  & F(1) = 1\
  & F(n) = F (n - 1) + F (n - 2)
$

@fibonacci_ln contains two different implementations of the fibonacci function: one in Lithium,
and a recursive one in C.

The #ln version uses the compiler defined functions `__dup__` and `__eq__`.
`__dup__` has the type signature $ast.basic (int times.circle ~(int times.circle int))$,
which means it takes a tuple containing the integer to duplicate, and a continuation that takes the
two new integers as argument.
`__eq__` has type signature $ast.basic (int times.circle int times.circle ~(fatone plus.circle fatone))$.
This function takes two integers to check for equality, and a continuation that takes the result as argument.
The value `inl ()` represents true and the value `inr ()` represents false.

As can be seen in the benchmark in @fibbo-benchmarks, there is a substantial
execution time difference between the version written in #ln and the version written in C.
For instance, when calculating the 40th fibonacci number, #ln took around 8 seconds,
the unoptimized C version took around 0.8 seconds, and optimized C version took 0.2 seconds.
Each input was measured 100 times, and the presented result is the average
execution time for each fibonacci number.
The C version was compiled using GCC with O0 and O3.

The execution time grows exponentially, but the difference remains almost constant.
This can be observed if we overlap the results over
each other (see @fibbo-benchmarks-overlap). We can see that the unoptimized C version grows
the same way as the #ln version, while the optimized C version is slightly
more efficient.
#figure(caption: [Benchmark from @fibbo-benchmarks with results overlapped.], overlap)<fibbo-benchmarks-overlap>

The performance difference we can see @fibbo-benchmarks
can be attributed to several factors but the two most significant ones
are most likely that #ln is currently not optimized at all, and it
generates more code than is likely necessary. Also worth to note
that the calling convention is less performant than System V @SystemVmatz2013system which
C uses. System V prioritizes passing arguments using physical registers while #ln
strictly passes arguments on stacks.

// Overall a benchmark is currently not necessarily that interesting #todo[Either remove the entire chapter or this paragraph] in #ln current state.
// They are presented here nonetheless to showcase some of the language's current capabilities.
