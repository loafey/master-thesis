= Discussion

This chapter presents a simple benchmark of #ln using the
recursive fibonacci function, compiled using
the #ln compiler we developed in conjunction with this thesis.
We also compare it to the equivalent C program.
Furthermore, we also present and suggest future work for the language and the compiler.
