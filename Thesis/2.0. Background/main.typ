= Background

This chapter introduces the necessary context for #ln. We start by introducing
the logic in the form of the typed lambda calculus and linear types. We
continue by explaining continuation-passing style and its relevance in
compilers. The chapter finishes by presenting different compilation targets and
their upsides and downsides.
