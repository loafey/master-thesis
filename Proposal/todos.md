In 1.2:
- What do you mean by "inherently logic based"?
- You say [7] does not meet the criteria of SLFL because it is higher-order, but I don't think you mentioned this criterion earlier.

I'm not sure about the phrase "with regards to" here, but maybe the solution is to clarify: what is correctness with regards to linear logic? Each step should have a linear type system / use resources linearly / something like that?
