== What is #ln

#ln is a new programming language developed by us and our supervisor.

Can be summarized with:\
#indent[
  - System-level

  - Functional

  - Linearly typed

  - Continuation-passing style
]

== What should it be used for?
The use cases we hope to aim for are:\
#indent[
  - A compilation target for other languages

  - System level programming (if you want :) ) #todo[]
]


== Why use it as a compilation target?
#(pre.bullets)(
  first: false,
  numbered: false,
  [
    There are already so many choices for compilation targets?

    Some examples include:
  ],
  (
    [LLVM IR],
    [x86-64],
    [And probably many more...],
  ),
)
